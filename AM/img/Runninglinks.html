During the day, there is limited shade and lots of foot traffic.<br> <strong>Good to know:</strong>&nbsp;You’ll share the path with cyclists, so stay alert. Above 72nd Street tends to be more tranquil.<br> <strong>What you’ll see:</strong>&nbsp;From bottom to top, highlights include the Statue of Liberty, Chelsea Piers, USS Intrepid, art installations, the George Washington Bridge.<br> <strong>Route map:</strong>&nbsp;<a title="tourist run - long" href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/236736091" target="_blank">Regular</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a title="tourist run - short" href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/255553577" target="_blank">Short</a></p>
